//step 1. set the starting node. (this is the start node.)
//step 2. set the distances of all nodes as infinite except the starting node.
//step 3. find the neighboring nodes with the starting node.
//step 4. update the distances of neighboring nodes as 1. change their isVisited to true.
//step 5. pick any of neighboring nodes and then repeat the process. at this point, neighboring nodes are 2.
//step 6. move to any unvisited neighboring node.
